/**
 * The person is an integral part in defying any people within the Airport,
 * whether it be a passenger, a crew member, or a control tower operator.
 * It is important to note that weight would play an integral part in how average fuel consumption calculations would be executed for when airplanes are flying.
 * Also, different age groups (defined by age) get different discounts in airports.
 * The person class will be used in an inherited manner to confine to SOLID principles.
 * The person has a unique id (for database purposes).
 * The name depicts the name of a person.
 * The surname depicts the surname of a person.
 * The dateOfBirth depicts the date on which a person has been born.
 * The age depicts the age of the person.
 * The weight depicts the weight of the person.
 * The object also has XML attributes for marshalling and unmarshalling.
 * The object xml accessor type is set to property (getters and setters) as per Java Beans conventions.
 * The object also has an MapperSuperclass tag for the database mapping.
