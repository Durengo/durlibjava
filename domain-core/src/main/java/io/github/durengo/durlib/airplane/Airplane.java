/**
 * This class is part of the object tree. It will be under the Airport class.
 * The airplane is the main point of an airport.
 * The airplane carries passengers and the crew to another airport.
 * The airplane has a unique id (for database purposes).
 * The destination airport designates the destination of the airport the airplane has to fly to.
 * The name is the name of the airplane.
 * The type is the type of airplane that defines all the characteristics (maxDistance, baseWeight, currentWeight, maxFuel, currentFuel, maxPassengers, currentPassengers, maxSpeed, averageFuelConsumption) of a plane.
 * The maxDistance is the maximum distance an airplane can fly in ideal conditions (empty cargo, full fuel tanks, excellent weather conditions), denoted in kilometers.
 * The baseWeight is the weight of the airplane when it has no passengers on board and empty fuel tanks, denoted in kilograms.
 * The currentWeight is the current weight with passenger weight and fuel amount, denoted in kilograms.
 * The maxFuel is the maximum amount of fuel an airplane can store, denoted in cubical meters.
 * The currentFuel is the amount of fuel that is currently store in an airplane, denoted in cubical meters.
 * The maxPassengers is the amount of passengers an airplane can hold (including crew members), denoted in people.
 * The currentPassengers is the amount of passengers currently present on an airplane (including crew members), denoted in people.
 * The maxSpeed is the maximum speed an airplane can technically reach, denoted in km/h.
 * The averageFuelConsumption is the amount of fuel that is consumed on average by an airplane when in flight, regardless of the conditions.
 * The airplane also holds a list of crew members.
 * The airplane also holds a list of passengers.
 * The object also has XML attributes for marshalling and unmarshalling.
 * The object xml accessor type is set to property (getters and setters) as per Java Beans conventions.
 * The object also has an entity tag for the database mapping.
 * All OneToOne and OneToMany relationships are cascaded.
 * All OneToOne and OneToMany relationships have LazyCollectionOption off so when objects are retrieved from the database, they can be instantiated.
